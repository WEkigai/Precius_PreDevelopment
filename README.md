# Precius : Pre-development
This repository is aimed for **archiving** the pre-development phase of Precius.
Please follow the current development on the [main project](https://github.com/WEkigai/Precius).

# Arduino proof of concept
The first proof of concept was built using Arduino Uno board and other off the shelf components sometime around 2021. The first code was developed by Gaurav Sharma and funded by WEkigai. On the mechanical side a crude setup of a heater coil and a probe sensor was used.

# ESP32 proof of concept
A second proof of concept was developed during 2024 by WEkigai using a ESP32 development kit and some off the shelf components. On the mechanical side, an esisting commercial product was modified to better approximate the final product system behavior.
